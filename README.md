# gacnativize
Simple utility that will GAC and NGEN assemblies matching a mask in a given folder.
This tool will keep track of failures on a subfolder named based on parameter --log-folder under the target folder.

The entries in the log file contained in this folder will be used as an exception list. Files in this list
will not be processed.
If any file name is preprended with a - (dash) sign it will be completely skipped and not even reported
in the console as skipped. Use this for know files such as native Windows dll files.
